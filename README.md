# Description üìù

This project implements a machine learning model for URL spam detection. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify URLs as spam or not spam.

# Installation üíª

To install the necessary dependencies, clone the repository and run the following command in your local environment:

pip install -r requirements.txt

### Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- Libraries: pandas, regex, nltk, scikit-learn (included in requirements.txt)

# Usage üöÄ

Follow these steps to run the project:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Load and clean data to remove duplicates and unwanted characters.
- **Text Processing**: Apply lemmatization and stopword removal to the URL texts.
- **Feature Extraction**: Use TF-IDF to convert the text into a numerical format suitable for the model.
- **Model Training**: The SVM model is trained with the processed data.
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Use GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters for the SVM model.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the accuracy of the model before and after optimization.

### Running Scripts
To run the main script, use the following command:

python app.py
